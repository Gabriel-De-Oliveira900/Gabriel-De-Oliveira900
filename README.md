About Me 🧑‍💻

Hello! I’m Gabriel Jorge De Oluveira Fernandes, an aspiring IT Consultant focused on building resilient, scalable, and self-sustaining systems. My journey began as a way to overcome limited access to professional tools, which led me to deeply explore open-source solutions. Over time, this evolved into a passion for crafting a universal, modular framework that sustains itself and serves as a platform for future IT innovation.

I am driven by the belief that knowledge should be accessible, adaptable, and resilient, and I’m excited to help individuals and organizations consolidate, structure, and preserve knowledge—while ensuring data integrity and historical context across systems.

🌌 The Ouroboros Framework(: A Holistic Approach to IT Systems 🐍(Launch 01.11.2024 Central Europe Time)

Overview

The Ouroboros Framework is a versatile, self-replicating template and documentation system, designed to:

	•	Provide a universal data structure for documentation, knowledge management, and IT systems.
	•	Maintain historical integrity and contextual accuracy across template versions.
	•	Enable modular adaptability so it can support a range of use cases, from virtual machine maintenance to multi-language categorization.

Why Ouroboros?
Named after the cyclical Ouroboros symbol, this framework is self-referencing and self-repairing—ensuring every version of a template is accessible and accurately contextualized.
